/// @brief Used to give commands specifically to the SWIG preprocessor
/// @details SWIG is a C/C++ source code preprocessor that reads source files
/// and produces an implementation of bindings for that language. Currently it
/// is only used for Lua. It can be used for other items in the future.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Prevent doxygen parsing of the items to insert in the bindings files
